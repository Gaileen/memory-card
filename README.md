# Memory Card Game

This is the Memory Card project from The Odin Project's React course. The purpose of this project was to practice using:
- useState() and
- useEffect().
Images are fetched from the PokeAPI.

To play, there are 12 unique cards. You must click as many cards as possible without repeating a card previously clicked on. If you do repeat-click a card, the game resets itself and you may try again.
